"Nest patrolling will involve leaving the nest, roaming around on the nest mound for a few minutes, and reentering the nest.",1,NA,0
"This behavior will be implemented in two parts, with a task-switching algorithm based on age.",NA,1,1
"Research shows that ants do change their behaviors based partly on their perceived life expectancy (Moron, et al, 2007), and that task-switching is partly genetically controlled by a switch in gene expression as the individual ages (Ingram, et al, 2005).",0,1,0
"It is therefore reasonable to assign a constant age at which Antie will switch from nest patrolling to trail patrolling.",NA,NA,0
"In order to perform both of these functions, Antie will need a subroutine to explore in a zig-zag fashion, as harvester ants do (Gordon, 34).",0,NA,NA
"Harvester ants display a preference to wander in familiar territory, though foragers and patrollers do sometimes wander into other nests’ territories (Gordon, 57-60).",NA,NA,0

"To control for this behavior, Antie’s explore subroutine will display a preference for exploration in places where there is a low gradient of nestmate pheromones.",1,1,0

"Because the midden work behavior is Antie’s initial default behavior, I will not address task switching to midden work.",0,1,0
"Workers probably switch to patrolling based on their perceived life expectancy and as a function of a gene whose expression changes between young and old ants, and this is easily emulated using a clock pulse counter in Antie’s CPU that will count its “age” since last boot.",NA,0,0

"The switch from patrolling to foraging has been modeled as a function of successful foragers’ returns with great accuracy by Schafer, et al (2006), and evidence from experiments in which successful foragers were removed before reentry to the nest does support the theory that returning successful foragers have an effect on the activation of new foragers (Gordon, 2002).",1,0,NA
"Infiltrating insect societies, however, is much simpler.",0,NA,0
"This is thought to be accomplished by the deposition of chemical markers from a gland on the abdomen that the patroller drags along the ground on her return route to the nest that the foragers may then follow (Gordon, 33-34; Holldobler et al, 1990, as cited in Webb, 1998).",NA,NA,NA
"Activated foragers form a queue to exit the nest and exit at a steady rate.",NA,1,0

"Conclusion",NA,NA,0
"Antie will be a fully autonomous, situated and embodied agent, infiltrating a red harvester ant colony and providing valuable information not only about the hypothesized rules of these ants’ behaviors and their task-switching thresholds, but also about the combination of complex behaviors into a single autonomous system with the ability to switch between behaviors as necessary.",1,1,1
"In addition to following these trails to the food, foragers must also be able to identify food, grasp it and carry it back to the nest.",NA,1,1
"Biomimetic robots have long been a rich source of information for both biologists and robotics engineers, and complex robots that can switch tasks as the situation demands and communicate information about current tasks could be useful for further studies of complex robot behaviors as well as for the obvious practical applications of robot swarms, such as on the battlefield and standard building maintenance.",NA,NA,0

"In fact, “More rail cars passed under the Center Street Bridge [a major bridge in Youngstown] per day than any other location in the country.”",1,NA,NA
"During the 19th century, the center of iron manufacturing had gradually shifted from the far East Coast (Massachusetts and Eastern Pennsylvania) to the Ohio Valley Pittsburgh regions of the Northeast, including the Mahoning Valley and the Hanging Rock region of Ohio and Kentucky.",NA,NA,NA
"By 1880, Youngstown’s population had grown to nearly 16,000, which meant it had doubled in size over a twenty-year period.",1,1,0
"The town continued to prosper, driven by the flux of immigrants pouring in with the hopes of employment at the mills.",1,NA,NA
"This prosperity continued until the late 1920s, when the Great Depression hit the area hard.",0,1,0
"Despite the Congress of Industrial Organization’s successful efforts to establish a national steel workers’ union, the industry barely survived the Depression years.",0,0,0
"Finally, the outbreak of the Second World War made iron and steel important again, and Youngstown was bolstered out of its economic standstill into a fast-paced period of booming growth.",1,NA,NA
"Strikes racked the town during the forties, fifties, and sixties, and they were often long and bloody.",0,0,1
"In 1973, the Experimental Negotiating Agreement was signed.",1,NA,NA
"This prohibited strikes and lockout, angering workers and driving productivity and laborer morale down.",0,0,1
"At the same time, stricter governmental standards for environmental protection and the growth of imported steel were making it harder to produce and market American steel parts, and the overeager shareholders in the companies’ stock were pushing for more and more of their share of the pie.",1,0,0

"Between 1977 and 1981, a total of five mills were closed and approximately 25,000 jobs were lost countywide.",0,NA,1
"Meetings of union officials and mill bosses were hurriedly set up in an attempt to persuade the powers that be to reconsider their statement.",NA,1,1
"However, it was clear that, in the words of USWA president Lloyd McBride, “If you can’t make a buck, you get out of the business.”",NA,NA,1
"On that date Jennings Lambeth, president of Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, announced that most of the steel company’s Campbell Works would close.",0,0,1
"“If you can’t make a buck, you get out of the business.”",0,1,1

"Those that could afford to move did so; those that couldn’t afford to move mostly ended up on the streets.",0,0,1
"Without an industrial or a residential base, commerce shrank considerably.",0,0,NA
"It was becoming increasingly clear that without the industrial base provided by the mills, the city of Youngstown would soon become a ghost town, inhabited by those too poor or hopeful to escape.",0,0,0
"The workers decided they needed to do something to save their city, and so they mobilized in a variety of ways.",1,1,1
"Attempts to Save the Mills",NA,0,0
"The very first thing that the workers could do was “to get up a petition to stop the shutdown,” says Ed Mann, a local union leader and organizer.",0,NA,0
"“to get up a petition to stop the shutdown,”",1,1,1
"The petition was circulated, eventually including thousands of signatures; it was then given to USWA representatives to present to President Carter in Washington.",1,1,1
"However, the representatives were shunted to the side and ignored in Washington, since Youngstown’s political influence had died with its industry.",0,NA,0
"The International chapter of the USWA had much more lobbying power, but they refused to support the local union members.",0,1,NA
"The petition was lost among paperwork and bureaucratic procedure.",0,NA,0
"Next, workers decided to form the Ecumenical Coalition, an organization of local religious groups which spearheaded the attempt to reopen the Youngstown works.",1,0,NA
"The Coalition drafter letters to the Lykes Company asking if a group of workers might purchase the mill and run it collectively.",1,1,1
"Although for other cities this would simply be a minor economic setback, for the people of Youngstown and the surrounding area, it meant disaster.",0,0,1
"Lykes ignored the letters, so the Coalition turned once again to the federal government.",0,1,0
"Here, too, they were ignored.",0,0,0
"The Coalition had no proper funds to buy the mills, so they could do nothing but sit back and watch as the mills closed.",0,0,NA
"Finally, following the shutdown of US Steel’s plant in 1980, local union leaders congregated outside the US Steel Headquarters in Youngstown.",0,NA,1
"They invited local people and politicians to witness the scene, then charged the Headquarters and took it over.",1,1,0
"The workers stayed there until the next day, when US Steel declared that they were ready to talk about selling the mill.",0,NA,NA
"Immediately after the workers left the building, US steel representatives told the local union leaders that they had changed their minds and were no longer interested in allowing the workers to purchase the mill.",0,1,NA
"All these efforts eventually came to nothing, and Youngstown’s steel mills remained closed.",0,0,0
"These attempts to save the mills were hindered by several major factors, including the decline of the world steel market, which made American steel impossible to sell or export.",0,0,0
"The Decline of the World Market",0,0,1
"The efforts to save the mills failed partly because the international market for steel had largely dried up.",0,0,0
"In fact, American steel imports were beginning to outweigh exports.",0,1,1
"Foreign steel was easier and more efficient to make, and was often of higher quality than domestic steel.",1,NA,NA
"Mahoning County was a one-industry area, and the people of Youngstown, Struthers, Campbell, Boardman Township, and the numerous other small towns and villages in the area only had one main employer: the steel mills.",NA,NA,NA
"Foreign steel companies invested in their factories, updating their technology and replacing their equipment often.",1,NA,NA
"This meant that foreign facilities were more modern and efficient than any plants in America, and therefore were able to export a more competitive product.",0,NA,NA
"Foreign steel was also much cheaper.",NA,1,0
"Wage hikes, although they helped to improve living conditions of steel workers in the US, made American steel far more expensive.",0,1,0

"A truce established between the Liberals and Conservatives failed to meet the demands of the Communists, who in turn sustained guerrilla attacks in response.",0,0,1
"Guerrilla warfare has since become a part of Colombian life; multiple groups maintain an ongoing presence, often stationing themselves in the remote mountainous villages often populated by various indigenous peoples.",0,0,NA
"This process leads to the development of what can be broadly termed culture: a group of people joined by characteristics, traits, and beliefs comes to view themselves as sharing a distinct identity, discernible from that of those “outside” them, those who do not belong.",1,NA,0
"This is similar to the situation of Guatemala: the government felt it needed to battle communism, an “armed and dangerous menace within”, plunging the country into civil warfare in the 1960s and continuing through the 1980s (Warren 1993: 25).",0,0,NA
"This resulted in persecution against the Mayans, who make up about 60% of the overall population. In both counties, guerrillas were often associated with the native peoples; in many cases there were coalitions, but in others the guerrillas merely used the remote, inaccessible villages as hideouts.",0,1,NA
"In Guatemala over 450 villages were destroyed, 200,000 Mayans were killed, and over 1 million more were displaced.",0,NA,NA
"The main guerrilla force was demilitarized in 1996 with the establishment of a peace accord (Warren 2002: 157-158).",1,NA,NA
"The growth in popularity and militarism of these popular leftist movements is intertwined with the development of the indigenous revitalization movements.",0,NA,NA
"By the 1970s the need to assert a cause separate from the general left was seen, and indigenous rights movements formed (Warren 2003: 174, Jackson 2002: 82).",0,NA,0
"Central to these was the question of indigenous identity:",NA,0,0
"Pan-Mayanism in particular has sought to organize itself around the Mayan language; despite local dialectical differences, it is seen as the unifying force behind the diverse Mayan people.",1,0,0
"Most still speak it in various forms, and efforts by Mayan linguists to standardize the language are producing a coherent, modern version of Maya (England 2003: 733, 739).",1,NA,NA
"Pan-Mayanism has succeeded in part due to its focus on issues of ethnicity; it largely avoids specifically political overtones, instead concentrating on the development of the reemerging Mayan culture (England 2003: 734).",NA,0,0
"The popular left, however, continues to see the rhetoric of ethnic rights as a politically viable tool.",0,1,0
"It therefore often invokes the banner of indigenous rights in its own discourse .",0,1,0
"The Pan-Mayan movement thus benefits from the lasting influence of the popular left on Guatemalan governmental policies without risking drawing the (often negative) attention of the government (England 2003: 735, Warren 2003: 181).",0,NA,1
"A main concern among pan-Mayanists is the reversal of the long-seated inferiority complex of the Mayan people; despite their position as majority within the Guatemalan population, they remain impoverished and marginalized on the fridge of society.",0,NA,NA
"Naturally this can be signaled by any number of things - clothing, food, lifestyle choices.",NA,NA,NA
"This results in part from the ingrained influences of Spanish colonialism: Spanish continues to be associated with modernity and social mobility, whereas Maya is seen as backward and inferior.",0,1,0
"Pan-Mayan leaders therefore seek to develop a return to Maya as it was in its classical renaissance, a language of power and prestige (England 2003: 736).",NA,NA,0
"By doing so they hope to inculcate among the Mayan peoples a renewed sense of pride which will in turn reverse the dogma of Spanish superiority.",NA,NA,0
"Colombia, in contrast, has no unified ""pan-Indian"" sentiments; the indigenous population is a small fraction of the overall population, a fractured entity divided by region and language.",NA,NA,0
"Several competing and oftentimes conflicting indigenous rights advocacy groups have developed: the ONIC poses itself as the sole pan-Indian group, yet lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 83, 85).",NA,NA,0
"One of the most dominant and easily noted factors is language.",NA,1,NA
"The CRIC, which focuses on language development and renewal, is primarily representative of the Nasa peoples (Jackson 2003: 82).",NA,NA,0
"It often stands in conflict with the AICO, its Guambiano counterpart (Jackson 2003: 83-84).",0,0,0
"Whereas the Mayanists benefit from a single main identity, those of Colombia must operate under historical differences between the various ethnic groups (Jackson 2002: 109).",NA,NA,NA
"The Nasa and Guambiano have stood in opposition since pre-colonial times; therefore any coalition between the two advocacy groups is tenuous at best (Rappaport 2005: 2).",NA,NA,NA
"This reflects a desire among the peoples themselves to maintain distinct ethnic identities, both from the Spanish Colombian population and each other.",1,1,NA
"The command of a language, while not affording guaranteed access to the community which speaks it, is often the key to gaining entry.",1,NA,0
"In the 1990s the rhetoric of ""cultural diversity"" was picked up the Colombian media, and subsequently entered the consciousness of the greater metropolitan public, thereby cementing its place in Colombian society as necessity and further complicating the role of indigenous movements in gaining rights for indigenous peoples as a whole.",0,0,NA
"A major success in the Colombian saga is the revamped constitution of 1991, which includes a section on indigenous rights, as the Congress which drafted it included representatives from native groups (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57).",1,1,0
"Central is a return to the old land grant system stemming from the repartimentos of the colonial era along with judicial sovereignty.",0,NA,0
"While the repartimento was originally used to repress the indigenous groups, it is now used to support them: resguardos, or communally owned plots of land, are granted to communities.",1,1,1
"They are ruled by the cabildo, local governing boards formed of community leaders (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 51-52).",NA,NA,0
"The return to customary law reflects a substantial shift in indigenous identity:",NA,NA,NA
"no longer ruled by Western laws and discourse, communities are forced to assess the efficacy of their old judicial systems in light of the modern era.",1,0,0
"In turn communal identity can be formed around a language; it is used as the focal point around which the group gathers.",1,NA,NA
"The oral nature of jurisprudence directly conflicts with the desire of the Colombian government to codify law, and questions of human rights violations are common as punishments are often corporal in nature (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57-58).",NA,NA,0
"The Colombian constitution stands in stark contrast to the failure of the Guatemalan indigenous rights referendum of 1999.",0,0,1
"Mayans gained formal recognition in 1995 as the majority population in a precursor to the 1996 peace accord; by 1999 its government floated a referendum on an indigenous bill of rights resembling that codified in the Colombian constitution (Warren 2002: 157-158).",1,1,0

"The study had two sessions, in November then February.",NA,NA,0
"In the first session , the 159 participants read passages about lay theories (much like in study one, but with longer passages to strengthen the manipulation), listed the resolutions they were planning on making at New Years, rated how disappointed they would be if they failed to keep their resolutions, and filled out individual difference measures (which included a self-efficacy scale).",0,NA,0

"As shown in the first two studies, more goals were set by people who believe self-control is unlimited and malleable than by any other people--that is, if you expect more success, you may increase the difficulty and number of tasks that you set for yourself.",NA,NA,0
"Self-efficacy did not have a significant effect on goal-setting.",0,NA,NA
"As far as success goes, only the interaction between lay theory and self-efficacy was significant.",0,NA,0
"If participants believed in limited self-control and were low in self-efficacy, they tended to give up more often, failing to achieve their goals.",0,NA,0
"But if participants believed in unlimited self-control, self-efficacy had no effect; participants achieved just as many goals regardless, and people who set more resolutions were marginally more likely to succeed.",1,1,0
"Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani realize that their research does not directly look at the relationship between lay theories of self-control and beliefs about one's own amount of self-control and self-efficacy, and propose this as an area for future study.",NA,NA,NA
